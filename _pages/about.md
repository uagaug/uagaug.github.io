I am a postdoc in the [Elowitz Lab](http://www.elowitz.caltech.edu/) at Caltech starting May 2019. My work focuses on building synthetic circuits from scratch, using _de novo_ designed proteins.

I attended graduate school at University of Washington with [David Baker](https://www.bakerlab.org/). My PhD work focusd on making the protein version of Watson-Crick base pairing. I computationally designed and experimentally verified sets of orthogonal protein homodimers and heterodimers ([_Chen et al., Nature 2018_]((https://uagaug.github.io/files/2018nature.pdf))). I also showed that their specificity could be programmed the same way we program specificity in DNA. I further redesigned the homodimers to self-assemble into regular 2D protein sheets ([_Chen et al., JACS 2019_]((https://uagaug.github.io/files/2019jacs.pdf))).
