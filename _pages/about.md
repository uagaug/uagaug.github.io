I am a postdoc in the [Elowitz Lab](http://www.elowitz.caltech.edu/) at Caltech starting May 2019. My work focuses on building synthetic circuits from scratch, using _de novo_ designed proteins.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Washington with [David Baker](https://www.bakerlab.org/) and [Frank DiMaio](https://dimaiolab.ipd.uw.edu/). My dissertation work focusd on making the protein version of Watson-Crick base pairing. I computationally designed and experimentally verified sets of orthogonal protein homodimers ([_Boyken et al., Science 2016_](/files/2016science.pdf)) and heterodimers ([_Chen et al., Nature 2018_](/files/2018nature.pdf)). I also showed that their specificity could be programmed the same way we program specificity in DNA. I further redesigned the homodimers to self-assemble into regular 2D protein sheets ([_Chen et al., JACS 2019_](/files/2019jacs.pdf)). 

As an undergrad I worked with [Erik Winfree](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/~winfree/) and [Lulu Qian](http://www.qianlab.caltech.edu/) at Caltech to build cargo-sorting [DNA robots](/files/Thubagere et al. 2017 - A cargo-sorting DNA robot.pdf) &mdash; perhaps the world's smallest couriers.
