[12] **Chen, Z.**, Kibler, R.D., Hunt, A., Busch, F., Pearl, J., Jia, M., VanAernum, Z.L., Wicky, B.I.M., Dods, G., Liao, H., Wilken, M.S., Ciarlo, C., Green, S., El-Samad, H., Stamatoyannopoulos, J., Wysocki, V.H., Jewett, M.C., Boyken, S.E., Baker, D., (2020). De novo design of protein logic gates. _**Science**_ 368, 7884.

* Synthetic biology has traditionally focused on building nucleic acid-based circuits, thanks to the ease of programming DNA or RNA molecules. Now that we have proteins that behave in a similar way (Refs 2, 5, 10), wouldn't it be fun to build protein-based circuits? Here we demonstrate, on the molecular level, a way to create logic gates from scratch, using _de novo_ designed heterodimers. These _de novo_ designed building blocks offer not only programmability, but also robustness and transferability: they work as purified proteins, in cell-free extracts, yeasts, and T cells.

* Native mass spectrometry is a technique that reveals the mass of protein complexes without destroying the non-covalent bonds that hold them together. Our collaboration with the Wysocki lab at OSU has been extremely fruitful, and here is a detailed protocol for doing high throughput native mass spectrometry, a core technique we used in Ref [5].

* This [Science & SciLifeLab Prize](https://www.sciencemag.org/2019-scilifelab-winners?utm_campaign=nyhetsbrev&utm_medium=email&utm_source=apsis) essay summarizes my PhD work. It describes a way to achieve DNA-like programmable specificity in proteins via computational design, which extends to the creation of a large set of orthogonal protein heterodimers, protein-based logic gates that operate in living cells, and lego-like proteins that self-assemble into two-dimensional materials.

* We created a large set of _de novo_ protein heterodimers, which bind each other specifically via the protein version of Watson-Crick base pairing. This set of orthogonal heterodimers should enable a variety of synthetic biology applications (protein logic gates, bio-orthogonal circuits, etc.) [PDF](/files/2018nature.pdf), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2019/04/04/the-engineering-of-living-organisms-could-soon-start-changing-everything), [Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2018-12-scientists-proteins-pair.html)
